# Prepare Application for Deployment

In order to deploy to Render, we will be relying on the app being committed to a git repository. If not committed to a repository, do so now.  Then make (and commit) the following changes to the project:

## Node Version:

We will need to be explicit about the version of Node we are using. Include this additional entry

### package.json

~~~json
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0"
  }
~~~

Make sure you do not introduce any syntax errors when you bring this into the file.

## Application Port

We need to make a small change in server.js, changing the way the server is created by append. This is our current server connection:

### server.js

```javascript
const server = Hapi.server({
  port: 3000,
  host: 'localhost',
});
```

Change to this:

```javascript
const server = Hapi.server({
  port: process.env.PORT || 3000,
});
```

## Environment Variables

Before deploying the application - we need to revisit our .env file. We will need to have the mongo connection string to refer to a version of the database available in the cloud (in Mongo Cloud Atlas for instance):

```bash
cookie_name=donation-web
cookie_password=secretpasswordnotrevealedtoanyone
# db=mongodb://localhost/donation
db=mongodb+srv://playtime:playtime@cluster0.rhZZZmAA4m.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Recall, these are loaded when our application starts, and are essential configuration parameters. We are loading these parameters in `index.js` like this:

```javascript
const result = dotenv.config();
if (result.error) {
  console.log(result.error.message);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

Currently this environment may not be committed to git, via this entry in .gitignore:

~~~
.env
~~~

For the moment, comment this out so that it will be in fact committed to git:

~~~
#.env
~~~

We will revisit this later.
