# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Environment Variables

On the Render Dashboard for the app, we have an Environment panel:

Currently theses values are defined in our .env file:

~~~bash
cookie_name=donation-web
cookie_password=secretpasswordnotrevealedtoanyone
db=mongodb+srv://playtime:playtime@cluster0.rhZZZmAA4m.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
~~~

... and this is committed to git and pushed to render. An alternative to this approach is to define environment variables on Render, with these values - and remove the .env file from git.

As currently configure, you will still need to have the .env file committed and pushed to GitHub - however you can have dummy values (or references to the local db) in the file - having them overridden by the values on the dashboard as specified above.

## Exercise 2: Glitch

When working with `fremium` services, is it useful to have more than one option. This can be important if the terms of service change (and the free tiers are removed).

Try deploying to the glitch service:
