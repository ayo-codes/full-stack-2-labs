# Timeout in Test Commands

We can run the tests from the command line:

~~~bash
npm run testapi
~~~

This triggers this script in  package.json:

## package.json

~~~json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
  ...
    "testapi": "./node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha --ui tdd test/api/**/*.js -exit --timeout 10000"
  },
~~~

We have appended the timeout onto this command above, the API tests should pass now:

~~~bash
npm run testapi

> playtime@0.9.0 testapi
> ./node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha --ui tdd test/api/**/*.js -exit --timeout 10000
